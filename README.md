# Using Machine Learning for Fake News Detection

This project is part of ANLY-521 coursework at Georgetown University.

This project explored the application of Natural Language Processing techniques for the detection of fake or misleading news stories that come from non-reputable sources. Naive-Bayes, SVM and RNN-LSTM machine learning techniques were used for analysis and a comparison of the efficiency of the methods was presented.
